# hippunfold-train-finetune
Workflow for training nnUnet with pre-existing weights

WIP.
Currently configured for incremental training on developingHCP neonate data.

Requires recent (e.g. latest) version of nnUnet which has the `-pretrained_weights` option. The nnUnet packaged with hippunfold pre-dates this option..
